What is this?
=============
This is libreoffice-voikko, a multi language spellchecker, grammar checker and
hyphenator extension for LibreOffice. It uses libvoikko for all linguistic operations.
Spell checking is supported for multiple languages. Other features are currently
available only for Finnish.

Porting status
==============
- Linux: This is the primary development platform, and should always work
- FreeBSD: Status unknown
- Windows: Should usually work without too much patching.
- Mac OS X: Version 10.5 (Intel) was supported, current status unknown.


Build requirements
==================

- LibreOffice 4.1 or later (Office and SDK).
- Libvoikko version 3.7 or later.
- On Linux: the C++ compiler from the GCC, version 3.4 or later. Other tools
  needed for compilation are usually present in default setups of any
  distribution.
- On Windows: Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 or later (the Express Edition is sufficient),
  GNU make, GNU sed and Info-Zip zip.
- On OS X: Xcode tools from the operating system installation CD.
  Static versions of libvoikko and its dependencies
  are needed to build a standalone extension.


Instructions for compilation
============================

- Install all of the required software listed above.
- In a shell, run the SDK setup script which is located in the SDK installation
  directory. It is called setsdkenv_unix on Linux and OS X, and setsdkenv_windows on
  Windows. During the first run, this script will ask the location of certain
  tools. You should answer the questions, although at least on Linux the
  defaults are usually correct. Answers to these questions will be saved under
  the home directory of the user (for example to a file
  libreoffice4.1_sdk/hostname/setsdkenv_unix.sh).
  * On OS X and Windows you must make sure that neither LibreOffice nor its
    SDK have spaces in their installation path. On Windows you can use spaces in
    these paths if you replace the components containing spaces with the "8.3" name
    during configuration of the SDK as follows:
      Office = C:\PROGRA~1\LIBREO~1.6
      URE = C:\PROGRA~1\LIBREO~1.6\URE
- Run "make oxt". This will build the extensions package voikko.oxt under
  subdirectory build.
  * There are some settings available that can be used to customize the build.
    Please see "build settings" in Makefile. You may change any of these settings
    by running "make VARIABLE=value" instead of "make".


Supported Make targets
======================

- extension-files
    Builds the extension files under build/oxt.
- oxt
    Builds the extensions package voikko.oxt under subdirectory build.
- all
    Same as 'oxt'.
- install-unpacked DESTDIR=some_directory
    Installs the unpacked extension under directory DESTDIR. Default
    for DESTDIR is /usr/lib/libreoffice-voikko.
- dist-gzip
    Builds the source package.
- clean
    Removes all files generated by other targets.


Diagnostic tools
================

Compiling libreoffice-voikko with DEBUG=LOG or DEBUG=FULL will create a
build that prints some useful diagnostic output to stdout.

To debug possible initialization errors in production builds, try listing
spelling suggestions for string "VoikkoGetStatusInformation". This will
return a string that contains all successfully initialized languages
and failed initializations along with error messages from libvoikko.


Bug reports and patches
=======================

Patches and bug reports can be sent to the author (hatapitk@iki.fi). The web
site for libreoffice-voikko is located at http://voikko.puimula.org


Change history
==============

Version 2.0 was an almost total rewrite of the previous version 1.2. This
version was designed to work well with libvoikko and aimed to use the best
current practices for OpenOffice.org extension development. The old code
was based on the internals of OpenOffice.org 1.0 and designed to work with
a non-free Finnish spellchecking library.

In version 2.0 the license was changed from LGPL to GPL to reflect the fact
that this extension is useless without libvoikko, which is distributed under
the GPL.

For changes since 2.0 see ChangeLog.
